# Prototyping Boards

Prototyping boards are used to wire ups circuits that you are testing out.  

Breadboards don't require soldering, which make them the easiest to use.  There are also prototyping boards (usually actually called prototyping boards) that you solder to, which provides more secure connections.

If you are happy with your circuit and you want a custom board, it's time to design a PCB (printed circuit board).  A common tool for this is [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download), and you can have the board you design printed at a PCB printing company like [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com).
